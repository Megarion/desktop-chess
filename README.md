# Desktop Chess
[YouTube video!](https://youtu.be/fsC_hRBJo9c)

Downloading and playing isn't the best idea (the game is meant to be watched)<br>
The program is buggy (and it's too machine dependent) and time-consuming to setup

If you don't care, here are the steps anyway

## Setup
Windows 10 exclusive
1. Right click on your desktop screen and click on the following options:
   - View > Small icons
   - View > Auto arrange icons OFF
   - View > Align icons to grid OFF
   - View > Show desktop icons ON
2. In `main.cpp`, replace all occurences of `user` with your Windows username.
3. After you play the game, delete all the chess icons

> Note: You will have to deal with a lot of minor inconvenicences (e.g. Only queen promotion)
